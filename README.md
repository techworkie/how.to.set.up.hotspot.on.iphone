**Instant Hotspot requires the following:**

* An iPhone 5 or newer running OS 8.1 or later
* * An iPad (4th gen and newer)
* An iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad mini (all models)
* You can use Instant Hotspot to connect to the above devices running at least iOS 8 as well as an iPod touch (5th generation) or newer. Macs running OS X Yosemite or later are also compatible.

* To connect a Mac to the hotspot device, go to the menu bar, select Wi-Fi status, then choose the name of the iPhone or iPad providing the Personal Hotspot.


* To connect an iPad, iPod touch, or another iPhone to the hotspot device, go to Settings > Wi-Fi, then tap the name of the iPhone or iPad providing the Personal Hotspot.
